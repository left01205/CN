✅ 1. Basic Commands of Networking (in Cisco Packet Tracer)
🎯 Objective:
Learn to use basic networking commands for testing and troubleshooting connectivity in a simulated network environment.

🧰 Tools Required in Cisco Packet Tracer:
2 or more PCs

Switch

Router (optional)

Copper Straight-Through cables

🛠️ Step-by-Step Procedure:
Step 1: Set Up the Network
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Drag and drop:

2 PCs from "End Devices".

1 Switch from "Switches".

Connect:

PC0 → Switch → PC1 using copper straight-through cables.

Step 2: Assign IP Addresses
Click on PC0 > Desktop > IP Configuration:

IP address: 192.168.1.1

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Do the same for PC1:

IP address: 192.168.1.2

Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0

Step 3: Use Basic Commands
Go to Desktop > Command Prompt on PC0 and try:

Command	Description
ping 192.168.1.2	Checks connectivity with PC1
ipconfig	Displays IP configuration of the PC
tracert 192.168.1.2	Shows the route taken by packets
arp -a	Displays the ARP table
netstat	Displays active connections
hostname	Shows the computer name

🔎 Expected Result:

Ping replies should be successful.

ipconfig should display IP details.

tracert will show direct route if devices are directly connected.

✅ 3. Virtual LAN (VLAN) in Cisco Packet Tracer
🎯 Objective:
Create and configure multiple VLANs on a switch and allow communication within VLANs while isolating them from others.

🧰 Setup:
1 Switch

3 PCs (PC0, PC1, PC2)

🌐 Scenario:
Create 2 VLANs:

VLAN 10 (Engineering): PC0, PC1

VLAN 20 (HR): PC2

🛡️ Goal:

PC0 and PC1 should communicate (same VLAN)

PC2 should NOT be able to ping PC0 or PC1 (different VLAN)

🛠️ Step-by-Step Procedure
🔌 Step 1: Build the Topology
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Drag:

1 Switch (2960)

3 PCs

Connect each PC to Switch FastEthernet ports using Copper Straight-Through cables.

🧾 Step 2: Assign IP Addresses
PC	IP Address	Subnet Mask	VLAN
PC0	192.168.10.2	255.255.255.0	VLAN 10
PC1	192.168.10.3	255.255.255.0	VLAN 10
PC2	192.168.20.2	255.255.255.0	VLAN 20

Configure this in Desktop > IP Configuration

⚙️ Step 3: Configure VLANs on Switch
Click the Switch > CLI and enter the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
enable
conf t

# Create VLANs
vlan 10
name Engineering
exit

vlan 20
name HR
exit

# Assign VLANs to ports
interface fastethernet 0/1
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit

interface fastethernet 0/2
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10
exit

interface fastethernet 0/3
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20
exit

exit
Assume:

PC0 is connected to Fa0/1

PC1 to Fa0/2

PC2 to Fa0/3

🔍 Step 4: Test the Setup
Go to PC0 → Command Prompt:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.10.3   # Should succeed (same VLAN)
ping 192.168.20.2   # Should fail (different VLAN)
Try from PC2:

bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.10.2   # Should fail

✅ 4. RIP – Routing Information Protocol in Cisco Packet Tracer

✅ This confirms that OSPF routing is properly set up between routers.

🧠 OSPF Notes:
Feature	Description
Metric	Cost (based on bandwidth)
Fast Convergence	Quickly adapts to changes
Area	Logical division to scale large networks
Classless	Yes (supports VLSM and CIDR)

✅ 6. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) in Cisco Packet Tracer
🎯 Objective:
Configure BGP, a path-vector routing protocol used to route between autonomous systems (ASes)—typically in large-scale networks such as ISPs or enterprise edge routers.

📌 Important Notes Before We Begin:
BGP is rarely used in small LANs.

In Packet Tracer, BGP is supported only in some router models (e.g., ISR 4321, 2811).

Each router must be assigned to a different Autonomous System Number (ASN).

🧰 Setup:
2 Routers (RouterA and RouterB — each in different AS)

2 PCs (one behind each router)

Copper Straight-Through cables for PC–Router

Serial/DCE cable between Routers

🌐 Scenario:
Device	Interface	IP Address	ASN
RouterA	G0/0 → PC-A	192.168.10.1	65001
RouterA	S0/0/0 → R-B	10.10.10.1	
RouterB	G0/0 → PC-B	192.168.20.1	65002
RouterB	S0/0/0 → R-A	10.10.10.2	

PC	IP Address	Gateway
PC-A	192.168.10.2	192.168.10.1
PC-B	192.168.20.2	192.168.20.1

🛠️ Step-by-Step BGP Configuration
🔌 Step 1: Set Up Topology
Connect:

PC-A to RouterA G0/0

PC-B to RouterB G0/0

RouterA to RouterB via serial S0/0/0

🧾 Step 2: Assign IP Addresses
RouterA:
bash
Copy
Edit
enable
conf t

interface g0/0
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit

interface s0/0/0
ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.252
clock rate 64000
no shutdown
exit
RouterB:
bash
Copy
Edit
enable
conf t

interface g0/0
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
exit

interface s0/0/0
ip address 10.10.10.2 255.255.255.252
no shutdown
exit
🌍 Step 3: Configure BGP Routing
RouterA (AS 65001):
bash
Copy
Edit
router bgp 65001
neighbor 10.10.10.2 remote-as 65002
network 192.168.10.0 mask 255.255.255.0
exit
RouterB (AS 65002):
bash
Copy
Edit
router bgp 65002
neighbor 10.10.10.1 remote-as 65001
network 192.168.20.0 mask 255.255.255.0
exit
🔍 Step 4: Test the Configuration
From PC-A:
bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.20.2   # Should be successful
From PC-B:
bash
Copy
Edit
ping 192.168.10.2   # Should work too
